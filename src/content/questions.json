          "a": "The small size of ADUs makes their impact on public infrastructure minimal, especially when compared to large single-family homes or multifamily dwellings. For example, the impact of ten ADUs with two people living in each would have the same impact as that of four large single-family houses with five people living in each."

          "q": "If my neighbor builds an ADU, will my property values go down?",
          "a":  "That’s unlikely. There is no conclusive evidence that ADUs negatively impact property values; on the contrary, ADUs can increase surrounding property values.  Zoning bylaws can also be crafted to ensure the design of ADUs is in keeping with the surrounding neighborhood."

Zoning that limits the use of tiny houses as short-term rentals can to ensure they serve those who want to live in the community, and towns can limit the number of tiny houses permitted."

For example, if a four-bedroom house that could accommodate a five-person family is converted to three one-bedroom homes each occupied by a single person or a couple, the overall number of occupants may not even increase."

In addition, conversions occur incrementally over time, so any increased parking demand will not overwhelm street capacity or traffic patterns."
