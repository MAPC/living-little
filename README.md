# Living Little

This is the production site for the [Living Little digital toolkit](https://living-little.mapc.org/).

## Development

This site was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and uses npm for package management. Install the Gatsby CLI globally with `npm install -g gatsby-cli`, then install local dependencies with `npm install`. Run the site with `gatsby develop`. Create working branches off of the `develop` branch, then merge commits from `develop` into `main` when ready to deploy to production. 

## Deployment

This site is built from the `gh-pages` branch. To deploy changes, push code to the `main` branch, then run `npm run deploy`.
