Following the end of WWII and the move towards single-family development, low-density suburbs, and increased zoning restrictions, ADUs lost popularity or were zoned out of existence. Beginning in the 1970s, a handful of municipalities began to write ADUs back into their zoning, recognizing ADUs as one solution to high housing costs. Nationally, Oregon and California are at the forefront of creating flexible zoning to encourage ADUs."],"tinyhouse":["At the start of the tiny house movement, most owners living in them were doing so illegally as their dimensions were oftentimes less than minimum building requirements. However, regulations for tiny houses have evolved. The majority of tiny houses are built on wheels, as it makes them easier to move and legal under RV laws and standards. Unlike mobile homes and RVs, tiny houses tend to be designed to architecturally resemble traditional homes. In 2016, Fresno was the first city to approve new rules to allow tiny houses on wheels to be parked on an existing residential property as an ADU."],"townhouse":["From the brownstones of Back Bay to historic homes in and around town centers across Massachusetts, townhouses have a special place in Greater Boston’s history. Originating in London and Paris, townhouses became popular in New England in part thanks to Bostonian architect Charles Bullfinch, who designed some of Boston’s first townhouses after spending time in Europe. Compact yet private, townhouses emerged as a popular housing type for the urban middle class. The townhouse concept was also widely employed to meet increasing demand for workforce housing during the industrial revolution.[1]"],"sfc":["In the mid-1900s, home conversions were conceived as mechanism to preserve large historic houses, many of which were originally designed for households that included extended family members and servants, that could no longer be maintained by a single owner. Today, they also provide the opportunity to create smaller homes in a way that is consistent with the scale and character of existing neighborhoods."],"mixeduse":["Mixed-use neighborhoods have been common in urban areas for centuries. In its earliest forms, mixed-use most typically consisted of a ground floor workshop or merchant space with living space for the shop owner above or behind. In the nineteenth century, residential apartments above a retail space became the prevalent typology for main streets in towns and small cities across the country.","However, with the advent of zoning in the 1920s, land use policies began to require separation of retail, housing, and manufacturing to protect public health. This trend became more pronounced in the mid-twentieth century as new suburban neighborhoods on previously undeveloped land were able to more fully separate different land uses. These suburban zoning regulations heavily favored single-family homes and auto-centric communities, making it difficult to realize the town commons and centers typical of the traditional New England community. Today, many towns in Massachusetts are utilizing mixed-use development to help revive aging commercial areas and create pedestrian-oriented communities."],"cottage":["Cottages first appeared on the Cape Cod peninsula as a more permanent form of the self-built summer campgrounds used before WWII. In the late 1930s, local zoning laws were created to stop these camp homes. While many cottages are illegal under existing zoning laws, a number of towns in Massachusetts and nationwide have recently updated their zoning to allow for cottage development in response to an increasing desire for smaller housing options that fit many towns’ suburban character. In a second phase of the Living Little project, MAPC worked with partner towns to study cottage housing and draft recommendations for cottage zoning."],"cohousing":["Cohousing is the term for an intentional community of private residences surrounded by shared open space and common areas, grounded in social connectedness and communal support. The concept of private dwellings around shared public spaces is centuries old, but cohousing in its modern form was pioneered in Denmark in the 1960s.[1] There are over 250 cohousing communities in the United States today, including several in Massachusetts. They attract a wide variety of people—families who want to raise their children in a supportive community, seniors who want to avoid the isolation often associated with aging, singles or couples who value communities with a diverse range of ages and household types, or anyone seeking connectedness and purposeful living.","[1] https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/oct/24/communal-living-grand-designs"]}'),k=JSON.parse('{"adu":{"advantages":["ADUs are often called “gentle density” because they expand housing options incrementally and within the context of a neighborhood.","ADUs offer creative options for multi-generational living, whether an adult child moving back home after college or a grandparent seeking to be closer to family support.","ADUs can provide extra income for homeowners on fixed incomes."],"why":["Many towns do not allow ADUs, or only allow them under very limited conditions, such as requiring that the main house be built before a certain year or requiring that whoever lives in the ADU be related to a person living in the main house. These rules can be difficult to change because, in Massachusetts, zoning changes require a 2/3 majority at Town Meeting.","Because ADUs are most often built by regular homeowners, rather than professional developers, it can be difficult to finance them. It’s most common for homeowners to use a home equity loan, but other options are becoming more common."]},"tinyhouse":{"advantages":["Some communities are now writing zoning specific to tiny houses, creating requirements for tiny house foundations, utility connection, and appearance. Tiny houses can also be permitted under existing zoning codes as mobile homes or accessory dwelling units with minor adjustments to town regulations, giving flexibility to communities in how they regulate this building type.","The International Building Code now has specific rules for Tiny Houses, providing consistent construction and safety standards.","While the market for tiny house villages is small, they are inexpensive housing options for those who do not require much space.","Thanks to television shows and social media, there is widespread interest in tiny houses, and they are becoming better understood by the general population."],"why":["Tiny houses on wheels are usually permitted as a recreational vehicle (RV) or a mobile home, and are only allowed to be located in trailer parks or other areas where mobile homes are permitted. Many towns do not allow them at all.","Tiny houses without wheels are usually permitted as a detached accessory dwelling unit, which in many towns are either not permitted or are allowed only under restrictive conditions.","It can be challenging to connect a tiny house to basic infrastructure utilities, such as water, sewer, and electricity, in a safe manner that meets the town’s regulations. Some towns have addressed this by requiring that the tiny house be attached to a foundation or connected to town utilities.","Concerns about building standards, health, and fire safety can deter town officials from allowing tiny houses. Furthermore, self-built tiny houses may not always meet building standards, and would need to be upgraded to comply with health and fire codes.","Unlike other Living Little housing typologies, tiny houses are a relatively new phenomenon and their regulation continues to evolve."]},"townhouse":{"advantages":["Townhouses now come in many different shapes and sizes, and they represent a single-family housing option that tends to be more affordable than large-lot detached homes.","Townhouses have long been appealing because they balance of privacy in a compact, efficient building footprint."],"why":["In many towns’ zoning bylaws, large setback requirements and lot coverage restrictions can effectively prohibit townhouses by precluding narrow parcels and/or common walls along lot lines.","Some towns’ subdivision regulations do not accommodate shared driveways, which are necessary in order to locate parking and trash behind townhouses instead of along the street.","Townhouses are constrained if a location is not served by public water and sewer lines. This is especially true in smaller towns and suburban communities, many of which rely on septic systems and have limited public infrastructure."]},"sfc":{"advantages":["Single-family conversions are a great way to preserve historic homes.","Converting single family houses of any style is a way to utilize existing housing stock to meet the needs of today’s smaller households.","Because they were originally designed as single-family houses and are already part of the neighborhood, most conversions are indistinguishable from other single-family houses and match the context of most areas."],"why":["You may just not notice them! Most single family home conversions do not dramatically change the external appearance of a home, leaving the character of the house and neighborhood unchanged.","Conversions must satisfy local zoning codes and comply with current building, life safety, and accessibility codes that, depending on the age of the building, may not have existed when the house was built, which can make conversions challenging.","Conversions require skilled developers, architects, and contractors that have specialized renovation expertise and a willingness to work creatively with local officials."]},"mixeduse":{"advantages":["As suburban communities continue to evolve, the separation of uses and the prominence of single-family zoning does not always align with town goals or residents’ needs or desires.

Additionally, retrofitting these aging commercial areas can create an opportunity to make the area more attractive and pedestrian friendly."],"why":["Many zoning bylaws require a special permit for mixed-use development or prohibit it altogether.","Many towns require a high number of parking spaces for retail, restaurants, or entertainment. This often mean it’s easier for a developer to build a conventional strip mall with an expansive parking lot.","The differing timelines for residential development and commercial leasing can make financing difficult.","Retrofitting existing strip malls presents unique challenges, including meeting the water and sewer requirements for housing, upgrading outdated structures, and incorporating pedestrian-friendly features in an area that was originally designed primarily for cars."]},"cottage":{"advantages":["Cottage designs are often familiar to residents currently living in larger homes, and are unlikely to feel out-of-place in towns that have mostly detached single-family houses.","New zoning rules and design guidelines specifically for cottage developments can encourage cottage development that fits into existing communities.","Cottage developments can create a transition between retail areas and neighborhoods with larger single-family homes.","Cottage developments allow for creative approaches to parking that best suit the site.","The common open space at the heart of a cottage development is intended to foster a sense of community among neighbors. This focus on green space, walkability, and community has become increasingly popular, particularly for downsizing seniors."],"why":["In many suburban towns, cottage clustered development is prohibited or requires an extensive approvals process.","Sometimes, the relatively higher density of cottage developments can be concerning by towns accustomed to single-family houses on large lots.","In smaller towns with limited water and sewer infrastructure, especially those that rely on septic systems, the higher density of cottage developments can pose a burden. However, cottage houses generally have fewer bedrooms and therefore accommodate fewer people than typical single-family houses, and cottage development site designs can be flexible enough to creatively approach limits to water and sewer capacity."]},"cohousing":{"advantages":["The type of common areas vary by community, but are usually far more extensive than a single common meeting room. They can include kitchen and dining areas, workshop or artist studio space, community gardens, game or social rooms, playground or indoor playroom, and more.","While cohousing can attract households of all ages and are commonly multigenerational, it offers particular benefit to seniors by mitigating physical and social isolation.","Beyond classic cohousing communities, home sharing and cohousing coordinated through digital platforms is a new trend occurring across the state and the country. Under this framework, residents interested in a shared living situation are connected through a digital platform or peer-to-peer website. Although these are not cohousing communities in the traditional sense and they are not formed in a grassroots manner, they share many of the same values as more traditional cohousing, such as shared meals, mutual assistance, and relationship building.","Cohousing communities can be legally structured as either a condominium, in which each resident owns the deed to an individual unit and common areas are maintained through monthly condominium fees, or as a limited equity co-op, in which each resident owns a share in the overall development. Limited equity co-ops often limit the resale value of an ownership share to maintain affordability."],"why":["Perhaps the biggest barrier to cohousing is lack of understanding. Town officials and financing entities unfamiliar with the concept may be at a loss for how to classify the development, and members of the public may be wary of this unconventional type of housing.","Cohousing is often a grassroots effort and future residents may lack the technical expertise to permit, finance, and construct a new development. It usually takes years to design and build a cohousing community, requiring sustained dedication from community members, and predevelopment costs like purchasing land or architecture, engineering, and legal fees can be extensive."]}}'),N=function(e){var t=e.typology,n=O[t].map((function(e){return o.createElement("p",{className:"history__paragraph"},e)})),i=k[t].advantages.map((function(e){return o.createElement(x,{description:e})}));return o.createElement("article",{className:"article"},o.createElement(A.Z,{title:"History",highlightWidth:85}),n,o.createElement("div",{className:"opportunity__wrapper"},i))},M=JSON.parse('{"adu":["ADUs can vary widely in size, from as small as 250 square feet to as large as 1,200 square feet.

As described in the example above, a conversion may not necessarily result in any increase in the number of bedrooms or occupants."},{"q":"What about parking?","a":"Homes suitable to conversions are typically larger single-family homes, which usually have driveways that can accommodate several off-street parking spaces. In addition, conversions occur incrementally over time, so any increased parking demand will not overwhelm street capacity or traffic patterns."}],"history":{"titleOne":"Convallis elementum","titleTwo":"Lorem donec","textOne":"Etiam sodales orci ut sapien ultrices efficitur.

A traffic impact study and/or parking analysis can identify potential impacts ahead of development."},{"q":"How will businesses in existing strip malls be impacted by redevelopment?","a":"Any commercial redevelopment, including strip malls, should engage with business owners to ensure that valued local businesses are not displaced.

Creative site plan design can ensure proper access to and between the houses in the event of an emergency."},{"q":"Won’t it feel cramped living so close to other houses?","a":"Cottage houses can be carefully designed so that they feel private – for example, windows can be staggered or private outdoor spaces can be put on one side of the house.
